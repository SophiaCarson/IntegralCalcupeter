Components complete: Frame/Screen created. Splash Screen done. Main Menu animations done. Main menu buttons complete.
Type of calculation select screen done, and so is most of the definite integral screen.

1/18/2015 - Final Program Completed. EconoCalc feature is also up and working, feature Consumer Surplus.

Next session: Blood Flow feature as well as other applications of integration features. If got lots of time, figure
out indefinite integration.

Known Issues:
* Program does not integrate properly if the lower bound integrand is greater than the higher bound integrand
* Program idling too long when calculating covergent infinite limits
